Question.1.Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even or odd using the ternary operator.
Ans:-Ternary operator is used to test the conditions similar to that of an if else block. It has three operands: condition,
statement if condition is true and statement if condition will be false.

condition ? value if true : value if false;

executed else the statement after the colon will be executed.
